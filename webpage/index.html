    <div class="blue">Rockstar San Diego is an American video game developer known for the Red Dead, Midnight Club, and Smuggler's Run franchises. Founded by Diego Angel in January 1984 as Angel Studios, it was initially a work-for-hire animation studio, working on films such as The Lawnmower Man (1992) and the music video for the song "Kiss That Frog" (1993). The company shifted towards video game development in the 1990s. In its early years in the sector, it was responsible for the Nintendo 64 port of Resident Evil 2 (1999) and cooperated with Nintendo on multiple projects. The studio's work on Midtown Madness (1999) attracted the attention of Rockstar Games, which worked with the studio on the Midnight Club and Smuggler's Run series, both first released in 2000. Take-Two Interactive acquired Angel Studios for Rockstar Games in November 2002, renaming the studio Rockstar San Diego. Under Rockstar Games, the studio developed Red Dead Revolver (2004), further Midnight Club games, and Red Dead Redemption (2010).</div>

    <div class="red">The male green-crowned brilliant is 13 cm (5.1 in) long and weighs 9.5 g (0.34 oz). It is mainly bronze-green with a glittering green crown, forehead, throat and breast. It has a white spot behind the eye, a small violet-blue throat patch, white thighs, and a deeply forked blue-black tail.[3]

        The female is 12 cm (4.7 in) long and weighs 8 g (0.28 oz). She differs from the male in that she has green-spotted white underparts, a white spot behind the eye and a white stripe below the eye, and a white-cornered shallowly-forked black tail. Young birds resemble the adult of the same sex, but are duller, bronze-tinged below and have buff throats.[3]
